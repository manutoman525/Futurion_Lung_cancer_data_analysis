#  Lung Cancer Analysis using SQL & Power BI 

Lung cancer is a leading cause of death globally, influenced by factors like smoking, air pollution, and genetics. This project analyzes a lung cancer dataset using **SQL** to extract insights and builds an interactive **Power BI** dashboard. The analysis covers **cancer prevalence, risk factors, mortality rates, and treatment effectiveness**. The three-page dashboard visualizes **demographics, smoking impact, survival rates, and treatment outcomes**. This project aims to provide **data-driven insights for early detection, prevention, and improved treatment strategies**.

# Lung Cancer Analysis

## Insights

### 1. Lung Cancer Prevalence and Air Pollution
- There is a strong correlation between lung cancer prevalence and high air pollution levels, indicating environmental factors significantly impact lung cancer rates.

### 2. Smoking and Lung Cancer Risk
- A clear relationship exists between years of smoking and lung cancer diagnosis, with higher smoking durations showing increased risk.
- Passive smoking also contributes significantly to lung cancer risk, reinforcing the impact of secondhand smoke exposure.

### 3. Early Detection and Survival
- Patients diagnosed at early stages tend to have longer survival years compared to those diagnosed at later stages.
- Early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates.

### 4. Mortality Rate and Cancer Stages
- Advanced-stage lung cancer patients show higher mortality rates compared to those diagnosed at an earlier stage.
- Countries with better healthcare access tend to have lower mortality rates due to early interventions and better treatment options.

### 5. Gender-Based Analysis
- The prevalence of lung cancer is higher in males than in females, aligning with smoking trends and occupational exposure factors.
- However, increasing cases among non-smoking females suggest other risk factors like air pollution and genetic predisposition.

### 6. Impact of Occupational Exposure
- Occupational exposure to harmful chemicals and pollutants significantly increases lung cancer risk.
- Workers in industries with high pollution levels exhibit higher diagnosis rates, emphasizing the need for protective measures.


### 7. Risk Factors Contribution
- Smoking remains the most dominant risk factor, followed by air pollution, passive smoking, family history, and occupational hazards.
- A multifactorial approach is essential in lung cancer prevention, considering all major contributors.
